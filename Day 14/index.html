    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to control the presentation and layout of web pages. It dictates how HTML elements are displayed, handling aspects like colors, fonts, spacing, and overall visual design. Essentially, CSS is the visual layer that makes websites visually appealing and user-friendly, while HTML provides the structure and content.</p>
